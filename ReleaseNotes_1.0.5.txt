    1.0 - geWorkbench Introduction and History
================================================================
 

    geWorkBench 1.0.5, an open source bioinformatics platform 
    written in Java, makes sophisticated  tools for data management, 
    analysis and visualization available to the community in a 
    convenient fashion.
 
    geWorkbench evolved from a project, caWorkbench, which was originally
    sponsored by the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics
    (NCICB). Some of the most fully developed capabilities of the platform
    include microarray data analysis, pathway analysis, sequence
    analysis, transcription factor binding site analysis,
    and pattern discovery. 

    geWorkbench 1.0.5 is primarily a maintenance and bug-fix release.
    All included components have been tested using formal, documented test
    procedures.  All known problems which could affect data quality or
    interpretation, or which could cause program failure, have been fixed.
    Any remaining known issues were deemed to be matters of convenience,
    layout, or feature requests.

    Several components included in previous releases have been removed from
    this release until they can be brought up to the desired level of
    integration with the rest of geWorkbench.  These include ARACNE and
    Reverse Engineering.




================================================================
    2.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================ 

    New features added in geWorkbench 1.0.5:

        No new Modules were added in this release.  This is a base release of
        well-tested modules.


    Changes from release 1.0.4:


        General

          All components using the Apache Axis code for SOAP
          communications were revamped such that each component now
          has its own copy of Axis.

          The caCORE code included in geWorkbench was updated to version
          3.1 to maintain compatibility with NCI servers.  The was
          necessary for such modules as the BioCarta Pathways retrieval.


        Annotations Panel

          caBIO database searches for gene information:

          - If the input dataset was associated with an annotations
          file when it was opened, then we retrieve the HUGO gene symbol
          associated with a marker (e.g., for marker 31335_at the HUGO
          symbol is IGF1R) and search caBIO using this gene symbol as
          a query. 

          - If the input dataset does not have an associated
          annotation file, then we do the caBIO search using the marker
          name. In this case we are restricted, as the only markers for
          which we will be able to retrieve information are the ones in
          the HU133 chip.

          Browser access to CGAP gene annotations:

          - In the past, clicking on a gene name hyperlink would
          directly bring up the corresponding CGAP page. Now, the
          users are provided with an option; namely they are asked
          which of the supported CGAP organisms (human or mouse)
          they want to retrieve info for. In the (near) future we
          plan to provide additional options here, such as searching
          Entrez Gene instead of CGAP.

          Extract markers/genes from pathways:

          - In the past, the only operation available for BioCarta
          pathways was the ability to visualize the pathway image
          in the caBIO Pathways component. Now, 2 more options
          are avaible:

          -- Add pathway genes to set: Selecting this option results in
          retrieving the HUGO sysmbols of all genes that comprise the
          pathway. For each such symbol XXX the application will try to
          find if the currently selected microarray set has a marker
          whose associated gene is XXX (obviously this will work only
          if the mocroarray set has been associated with an annotations
          file). If one (or more) such markers exist, then they will be
          placed in a marker set which will be named after the pathway
          and will be added in the Markers panel.

          -- Export genes to CSV: Information about all genes in the pathway
          is exported to a text file. The file contains as many rows as
          the genes extracted and each row contains 2 comma separated
          values: (1) a gene symbol, and (2) the description associated
          with that gene.



        Affymetrix Annotation files:

          Previous releases have included a copy of an Affymetrix
          annotation file for the HG-U95aV2 chip.  Due to licensing
          restrictions, this file is no longer included.  geWorkbench
          users who are working with Affymetrix chip data should retrieve
          the latest version of the appropriate annotation file for the
          chip type they using directly from

          https://www.affymetrix.com/site/login/login.affx

          A free account at Affymetrix.com is required.

          Current annotation files in CSV format are listed there.
          If you need an annotation file for an older file you can use
          its name in the search field on the web page, e.g. "HG_U95Av2".

          An example file from the Affymetrix site is
          "HG_U95Av2.na21.annot.csv.zip".  This file would need to be
          unzipped before use.  You can place the file in any convenient
          directory.  When you load a new data file, you will be asked
          for the location of the annotation file and can browse to it.

        
        Special Purpose hardware support removed:

          The JCSB no longer supports the Paracel BLAST machine or
          GeneMatcher 2 hardware. The interfaces to these special purpose
          computers have been removed from geWorkbench.  BLAST is
          still available in geWorkbench via an interface to NCBI.
          A replacement interface to run NCBI BLAST on a local JCSB
          cluster is under development.


        The following components are not included in this distribution, but
        were included in 1.0.4:   

          * ARACNE
          * Column Major Format
          * Frequency Threshold Filter
          * GCRMA Via R CEL Loader
          * Genotypic File Format
          * Interactions DB
          * Network Browser
          * Pattern Discovery Algorithm (association analysis)
          * Reverse Engineering
          * SVM Format
          * Synteny 

        
          A new, pure-Java version of ARACNE has been developed and will return
          to geWorkbench in a future release.  The Reverse Engineering component
          and associated Network Browser component are also being redeveloped.
          Other components may return in a future distribution as needed.





================================================================
    3.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
    Pattern Discovery

        In the Pattern Discovery module, the hierarchical discovery option
        has been disabled.  This is due to an unresolved communications
        problem with the ARACNE server.

    Gene Ontology

        The Gene Ontology component uses data files obtained from
        www.geneontology.org.  These files are in the older GO format,
        which is deprecated but still generated on a weekly basis at
        that site.  The geWorkbench download includes the three data
        files process, function and location, current as of the time
        of this release.  However, geWorkbench at present contains no
        method of updating these files.

        To update the gene ontology files, download them from:
        http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.ontology.shtml.
        These files must be copied into the GO
        Terms component class directory on your machine:

 geworkbench_root\components\goterms\classes\org\geworkbench\components\goterms,

        where geworkbench_root is the directory you downloaded geworkbench
        into.

        Due to the large size of these files, we have found that mapping
        the Process tree will work best if more than 1 GB of memory is
        installed in the computer.
