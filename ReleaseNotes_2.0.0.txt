    2.0 - geWorkbench Introduction and History
================================================================


    geWorkBench, an open source bioinformatics platform 
    written in Java, makes sophisticated  tools for data management, 
    analysis and visualization available to the community in a 
    convenient fashion.
 
    geWorkbench evolved from a project, caWorkbench, which was originally
    sponsored by the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics
    (NCICB). Some of the most fully developed capabilities of the platform
    include microarray data analysis, pathway analysis, sequence
    analysis, transcription factor binding site analysis,
    and pattern discovery. 

    geWorkbench 2.0.0 adds several new components contributed by the MAGNet
    Center at Columbia University.  It also adds  file parsers for
    MAGE-TAB and GEO Soft files, new filtering components, and includes many
    other new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.


================================================================
    3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================ 


Changes included in geWorkbench 2.0.0

    New components

    Skyline - A high-throughput comparative modeling pipeline. 
             It creates structural homology models for protein sequences
             with similarity to a protein with an experimentally determined
             3-D structure.  The input is a PDB file.
                
    Skybase - SkyBase is a database that stores the homology models built by
             SkyLine analysis for all NESG PSI2 protein structures.  It is
             queried using FASTA-format protein sequence files.
                
    Pudge -  Interface to a protein structure prediction server which integrates
             tools used at different stages of the structural prediction process.
             Modeling starts with a FASTA-format protein sequence file.

        protein cavities, and calculates the surface electrostatic
        potentials and amino acid conservation profile.

    2.  MRA - The Master Regulator Analysis component attempts to identify
        transcription factors which control the regulation of a set
        of differentially expressed target genes (TGs). Differential
        expression is determined using a t-test on microarray gene
        expression profiles from 2 cellular phenotypes, e.g. experimental
        and control.

    3.  Pudge - Interface to a protein structure
        prediction server (Honig lab) which integrates tools used

        components rather than being a separate component itself.
     6. caScript - The caScript editor is no longer supported.  
     7. Color Mosaic - now interactive with the Marker Sets list and Selection set.  
     8. Cytoscape - Upgrade to Cytoscape version 2.4 for network visualization
        and interaction.
     9. Cytoscape - Set operations on genes being returned from
        Cytoscape network visualizations, via right-click menu.
    10. Cytoscape - Changes to tag-for-visualization - e.g., now only
       one way, from marker set to Cytoscape, not vice-versa.  
    11. Gene Ontology file - the OBO 1.2 file format is supported.  
    12. Marker Annotations - Direct access to the NCI Cancer Gene Index was
        added. It supplies detailed literature-based annotations on a
        curated set of cancer-related genes.  
    13. Marker Annotations - add export to CSV file.  
    14. Marker Sets component - a set copy function was added.  
    15. MINDy - many improvements to display and results filtering - including
        marker set filtering.  
    16. Scatter Plot - Up to 100 overlapping points can be displayed in a single
        tooltip.  
    17. Various - A number of components were refactored.
    18. Workspace saving - now works properly for all components.

    Changes included in geWorkbench 1.6.0

    * Adds Mindy component
    * The GO Terms component is not included in this release.  It will
           return in a future release.
    * Fixed a problem (caused by a change in a server-side URL) with
        retrieving annotations for genes in Biocarta pathway diagrams (bug 1577).
    * The default caArray server was set to the production server at NCI
        (array.nci.nih.gov, port 8080) (bug 1602). The URL for the staging
      array was updated to array-stage.nci.nih.gov.
    * An incorrect argument was being sent to NCBI's BLAST server. Due to
        recent changes there implementing stricter checking, blastn would no
        longer run. (bug 1597).
    * Corrected a problem where, when using the adjusted Bonferroni correction,
        or the Westphal-Young with MaxT, only values with positive fold-changes
        were returned and displayed (bug 1603).
    * Added a feature whereby the user is warned before any operation that
        will alter the dataset, e.g. before filtering out markers, or before
        a log2 transformation.
    * Added a feature to allow adding a new empty marker set. This can then
        be used to receive markers selected interactively in Cytoscape (bug 1541).
    * Fixed a problem displaying patterns in the sequence viewer after running
        Pattern Discovery (SPLASH) (bug 1415).
    * Fixed a problem with displaying adjacency matrices generated by ARACNE
        in the Cytoscape component (bug 1449). 


    * Numerous changes were made to improve responsiveness, including when
          - selecting a marker in a large dataset (bug 1346),
          - right-clicking on Project with a large dataset (bug 1337),
          - saving a workspace (bug 1525), and
          - starting an analysis (bug 1544). 
     * Remaining changes, not listed here in detail, included
          - internal issues within geWorkbench,
          - improved verification of parameters and set selections before
            beginning a calculation,
          - improvements to the graphical user interfaces of many components, and
          - corrections to the grid implementations of analytical services
            (Hierarchical Clustering, SOM, ANOVA etc). 




    Changes included in geWorkbench 1.5.1:
. 
        *  It addresses changes in the APIs for the caArray and caBIO
           data services since geWorkbench 1.5 was released.  geWorkbench 1.5.1

        with Affymetrix chip data should retrieve the latest version of the
        appropriate annotation file for the chip type they using directly from

        https://www.affymetrix.com/site/login/login.affx

        A free account at Affymetrix.com is required.

        Current annotation files in CSV format are listed there.
        If you need an annotation file for an older file you can use
        its name in the search field on the web page, e.g. "HG_U95Av2".

        An example file from the Affymetrix site is
        "HG_U95Av2.na29.annot.csv.zip".  This file would need to be
        unzipped before use.  You can place the file in any convenient
        directory.  When you load a new data file, you will be asked
        for the location of the annotation file and can browse to it. 


     Grid Computations
        The reference implementations of the server-side grid-enabled algorithms
        currently are running on a single front-end server not meant for
        heavy computational use.  That server is not configured for computing on large
        datasets or for long-running jobs.
