                   3.0 Security Note
================================================================
       A java security policy is required to make calls against the
    caBIO server because the caBIO.jar uses Java RMI (Remote
    Method Invocation) calls to connect with the caBIO server.
    The policies defined in a java.policy file which can be found in 
	same folder as this README file. It is for the protection of 
	your system--not the caBIO server. Therefore,  you are 
	free (and encouraged) to edit the java.policy file
    as appropriate for your system. For more information, see:
    
        - http://java.sun.com/security/
