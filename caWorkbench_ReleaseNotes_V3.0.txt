    1.0 - caWorkbench Introduction and History
================================================================
 

    caWorkBench3.0, an open source bioinformatics platform 
    written in Java, makes sophisticated  tools for data management, 
    analysis and visualization available to the community in a 
    convenient fashion. 
    It evolved from a project which was originally sponsored by 
    the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB). 
    Some of the most fully developed capabilities of the platform
    include microarray data analysis, pathway analysis and 
    reverse engineering, sequence analysis, transcription factor 
    binding site analysis, and pattern discovery. 
 



================================================================
    2.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================ 

  New features added in caWorkbench3.0:
 
    --  Improvements to the application user interface (UI):
        * Addition of a new UI flavor, displaying components in a 
	drop down menu rather than in tabbed format. To use the 
	new flavor, start the application with "ant runNewFlavor". 
        * Addition of F12 navigation function in the tabbed skin.
	By clicking the "F12" key, a popup window will show a list of
	all available panels. The user can select any panel which 
	will then be automatically displayed.
    --  Improvements to the user interface of specific components such
	as Gene Panel, Marker annotations, GO Terms Panel, Synteny, 
	Reverse Engineering, Promoter Panel.
    --	Support for multiple-microarray loading.
    --  Support for data access from multiple caArray repositories.
    --	Scatter plot visualization for pair of markers and microarrays.
    --  New, faster and memory-efficient implementation of 
	hierarchical clustering.
    --	Expression value distribution plot. 
    --	Support for additional normalizers:
        * House-keeping gene normalization. 
        * Quantile normalization.
    --	Filtering of Genepix data using the "Flags" column.
    --	Editor-based viewing of input files corresponding to dataset nodes.     
    --	Preferences specification for:
        * Editor to use for viewing original data files.
        * Coloring scheme for mosaic gene expression representation.
        * Calculation of signal for 2-channel Genepix data.
    --	Support for user annotation on all nodes within the Project Folders. 
    --	Support for sorting by pathway within the Marker Annotation component. 




================================================================
    3.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
 Reverse Engineering and the Association panel are not fully
 fuctional when the application runs on a Macintosh.  This  is due
 to an issue with code to load libraries.
 
 The SequenceRetriever Panel only works with markers found on the 
	Affymetrix HG-U95 chip.

 Remote execuation of ARACNE in Reverse Engineering Panel is temprory disabled.
