    2.0 - geWorkbench Introduction and History
================================================================


    geWorkBench, an open source bioinformatics platform 
    written in Java, makes sophisticated  tools for data management, 
    analysis and visualization available to the community in a 
    convenient fashion.
 
    geWorkbench evolved from a project, caWorkbench, which was originally
    sponsored by the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics
    (NCICB). Some of the most fully developed capabilities of the platform
    include microarray data analysis, pathway analysis, sequence
    analysis, transcription factor binding site analysis,
    and pattern discovery. 

    geWorkbench 2.2.1 provides a number of improvements, especially as related
    to network import, display and export, sequence retrieval, and pattern
    discovery.  If a network is generated or loaded that may be to large to
    view in Cytocape, it can now instead by viewed as a text file.  The
    new "Fold Change" analysis component is included, which was to be released
    in version 2.2.0 but was omitted.  A new feature to overlay a t-test result
    onto a Cytoscape network, which was inadvertantly disabled in release
    2.2.0, now works again.  The Gene Ontology analysis component now supports
    uses of  alternate ontology files (e.g. from the GO website).  Sequence
    retrieval for DNA sequences is now done using the UCSC refGene table, and
    is available for all organisms with genomes supported by UCSC.

    3.0 Release History: New Features and Updates
================================================================ 

 geWorkbench 2.2.1 (2011-07-29)
    ==============================

    --- New features and changes in release 2.2.1---

    ANOVA
      - #2618 - Control buttons repositioned for easier use. 
      - #2694 - The simple range check as a test of whether data was
        log-normalized was removed.
    ARACNe
      - #2494 - Bonferroni correction option added. 
      - The "Choose edges with hightest MI" option was renamed to "Merge
        multiple probesets".
      - #2648 - The adjacency matrix is no longer made symmetric. Each line now
        starts with a hub gene.
      - Similarily, the adjacency matrix, when saved to file, is not made
        symmetric.
      - #2679 - The "merge multiple probesets" option was not recorded in
        the dataset history.
      - Merging of multiple probesets is now just within a hub gene, not global.
      - #2684 - When a subset of markers was activated, the grid service
        version used an incorrect offset into the marker list.  
    BLAST
      - #2665 - Previous search results were not cleared if a following search
        returned no hits.
    Color Mosaic
      - #2401 - Export button and right-click menu - both now support export of
        significance results (p-values) from both t-test and ANOVA. 
    CNKB
      - Export of network adjacency matrix from Project Folder omitted
        gene/probeset names. 
    Cytoscape
      - t-test overlay on network did not work in release 2.2.0 due to a
        late change.  Fixed.
      - #2650 - Display all networks at the gene level.  When multiple probesets
        represent a gene in the network, the network will be summarized at the
        gene level.  As a result, the count of the number of nodes and edges
        displayed in Cytoscape may differ from the counts present in, e.g.
        a complete ARACNe adjacency matrix (ARACNe probeset merging option not
        used).
      - #2589, #2638 - If a network might be too large to view in Cytoscape,
        the user is offered an alternate visualization (text). The threshold
        for warning can be changed by the user. This replaces warnings that
        were previously built in to several components e.g. ARACNe. Now, an
        adjacency matrix is always created, regardless of size.
      - #2597, #2598, #2599 - Inconsistencies in how selected nodes in
        Cytoscape were reflected as markers in the Markers component were found
        and fixed. 
    File Open Dialog
      - #2698 - The "merge" checkbox is no longer disabled when a file type is selected 
        which cannot be merged.  There were synchronization problems.
    Fold-Change Analysis
      - New component accidentally omitted from release 2.2.0.
    Network Import
      - Networks can now be imported either from Adjacency matrix files (#2432)
        or from SIF-format (#2434) files. The networks can be represented by
        gene symbols, Entrez IDs, or probeset names, or by some other identifier
        (#2432). Networks are represented in memory with the same identifiers
        that were imported. That is, if a network is read in using gene symbols,
        then it is represented at this level within geWorkbench. Probesets for
        each gene can be obtained as needed for particular analyses.
      - #2608, #2645 - On import, .SIF and .ADJ file extensions are
        automatically recognized.
      - On export, .ADJ is automatically added to file. 
    Gene Ontology Analysis
      - #2512 - The analysis now supports using an alternate annotation file
        rather than an Affymetrix annotation file. Organism annotation files
        from the geneontology.org website can now be used.
    GenSpace 
      - The J2EE framework used in geWorkbench 2.2.0 was replaced with one based
        on SOAP.
      - #2666 - The "Remove Friend" feature did not properly update the GUI.
    Marker Annotations
      - #2658 - a missing CGAP URL was added to the export file.
    MarkUs
      - #2622 - Added support for job description and email notification fields. 
    Master Regulator Analysis
      - #2610 - MRA can now be run from gene-level adjacency matrices created by CNKB.
      - #2301 - When saving results (target lists for MRs), a ".csv" file
        chooser is used and will append this extension automatically. 
    MINDy
      - #2659 - If MINDy was run remotely on the grid service, sorting on the
        modulators column of the results table did not work.
      - #2657 - The "All Markers" checkbox was removed, as its function has been
        taken over by a separate filter control.
      - #2314 - An inconsistency in how modulators and targets were
        selected/deselected with respect to the "Displayed Targets Filter" was fixed. 
    Pattern Discovery
      - #2682 - Some parameters were not properly captured in the dataset history.
      - #2672 - Pattern nodes were not always properly restored when the workspace
        was saved and restored.
      - #2664 - In Exhaustive discovery mode, the "min support" parameter is
        now input only as an integer representing the floor for support.  The
        option to enter the minimum exhaustive support as a percent of initial
        support was removed.
      - #2663 - If discovered patterns were saved to file and reloaded, they were
        not always displayed.
      - #2593 - Problems that occurred when a run was canceled or the server 
        was unreachable were fixed. 
      - The Pattern Discovery (Splash) server URL was changed to splash.c2b2.columbia.edu.
    PCA
      - #2670 - PCA did not run if geWorkbench was installed to a path containing a space.
    Project Folders
      - #2626 - Mousing-over a network node will display the number of nodes
        and edges in hover text.
      - #2646 - When saving a network, the ".adj" file filter will append
        ".adj" to the file created. 
    Sequence Retriever (#2630, #2631, #2632)
      - For DNA, now queries the "refGene" table rather than UCSC "known genes",
        so can now retrieve genomic sequence for all UCSC supported species.
      - The transcription start point was off by one in query and display.
      - Identifiers for retrieved sequences were being truncated if long.
      - The "local" option for sequence retrieval was removed.
      - The sequence location "spinner" controls can now be set to zero, and
        step in increments of 100. 

    geWorkbench Installer
      - When run in Windows, the installer version of geWorkbench now displays
        its correct icon in the Windows task bar.

    geWorkbench 1.6.0 (2008-10-24)
    ==============================
    - Adds Mindy component
    - The GO Terms component is not included in this release.  It will
           return in a future release.
    - Fixed a problem (caused by a change in a server-side URL) with
        retrieving annotations for genes in Biocarta pathway diagrams (bug 1577).
    - The default caArray server was set to the production server at NCI
        (array.nci.nih.gov, port 8080) (bug 1602). The URL for the staging
      array was updated to array-stage.nci.nih.gov.
    - An incorrect argument was being sent to NCBI's BLAST server. Due to
        recent changes there implementing stricter checking, blastn would no
        longer run. (bug 1597).
    - Corrected a problem where, when using the adjusted Bonferroni correction,
        or the Westphal-Young with MaxT, only values with positive fold-changes
        were returned and displayed (bug 1603).
    - Added a feature whereby the user is warned before any operation that
        will alter the dataset, e.g. before filtering out markers, or before
        a log2 transformation.
    - Added a feature to allow adding a new empty marker set. This can then
        be used to receive markers selected interactively in Cytoscape (bug 1541).
    - Fixed a problem displaying patterns in the sequence viewer after running
        Pattern Discovery (SPLASH) (bug 1415).
    - Fixed a problem with displaying adjacency matrices generated by ARACNE
        in the Cytoscape component (bug 1449). 


    - Numerous changes were made to improve responsiveness, including when
          - selecting a marker in a large dataset (bug 1346),
          - right-clicking on Project with a large dataset (bug 1337),
          - saving a workspace (bug 1525), and
          - starting an analysis (bug 1544). 
     - Remaining changes, not listed here in detail, included
          - internal issues within geWorkbench,
          - improved verification of parameters and set selections before
            beginning a calculation,
          - improvements to the graphical user interfaces of many components, and
          - corrections to the grid implementations of analytical services
            (Hierarchical Clustering, SOM, ANOVA etc). 




    geWorkbench 1.5.1 (2008-09-23)
    ============================== 
        -  It addresses changes in the APIs for the caArray and caBIO

          - ARACNE – gene network reverse engineering (from Andrea
              Califano's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Software). 
          - ANOVA – Analysis of variance, ported from TIGR's MEV,
              http://www.tm4.org/mev.html). 
          - caArray2.0 connectivity – query for and download data from
              caArray 2.0 directly into geWorkbench.
          - Cellular Networks Knowledge Base – database of molecular 
              interactions.  (from Andrea Califano's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://amdec-bioinfo.cu-genome.org/html/BCellInteractome.html).
          - GenSpace - provide social networking capabilities and 
          allow you to connect with other geWorkbench users.
          - MatrixReduce – transcription factor binding site prediction
              (from Harmen Bussemaker's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://bussemaker.bio.columbia.edu/software/MatrixREDUCE/).
          - Analysis components ported from GenePattern (http://www.genepattern.org)

           - The NCBI GEO series matrix file for microarray data (tab-delimited)

    ---New server side architecture---
           - Invocation of caGrid services is now delagated to an independent 
              component (the Dispatcher). This makes it possible to exit geWorkbench 
              after submitting a long-running job and then automatically pick up any 
              results next time the application starts. 

     ---Other changes---
          - The Marker and Array/Phenotypes components now support algebraic operations 
              (union, intersection, xor) on marker and array groups.
          - Upon exiting the application, the user is prompted to store their workspace.
          - Workspace persistence problems have been resolved.
          - The Marker Annotations component has been enhanced in several ways:
              -- The integration with caBIO has been updated to use API Version 4.0
              -- The caBIO Pathway component (previously an independent geWorkbench 
                    component that would display BioCarta pathway images) has been 
                    integrated into the Marker Annotations component.
              -- Markers can be returned from BioCarta pathway diagrams.
              -- A new option is provided to choose between human or mouse CGAP 
                    annotation pages.




================================================================
    4.0 Known Issues/Defects
================================================================
   
    ---Running BLAST on multiple sequences---
        The NCBI BLAST server may return an error when  multiple
        sequences are searched from geWorkbench.  The queries are sent serially,
        one at a time).   This appears to depend on the load on the
        NCIB BLAST server.
   
   
    ---Affymetrix Annotation files---

        Due to licensing restrictions, Affymetrix annotation files cannot be
        included in this distribution.  geWorkbench users who are working
        with Affymetrix chip data should retrieve the latest version of the
        appropriate annotation file for the chip type they using directly from
        Affymetrix.  geWorkbench uses the CSV format annotation files.

        Affymetrix annotation files can be downloaded from their support site,
        at www.affymetrix.com.  Although there are frequent changes to their website,
        the files can be found starging on the Support tab of the website:
        (1) the Technical Documentation section, e.g.:
            * Support->Affymetrix Microarray Solutions->Technical Documentation->Annotation Files 
        (2) Under "Support by Product".


        An example file from the Affymetrix site is
        "HG_U95Av2.na31.annot.csv.zip".  This file must be
        unzipped before use.  You can place the file in any convenient
        directory.  When you load a new data file, you will be asked
        for the location of the annotation file and can browse to it. 


    ---Grid Computations---
        The reference implementations of the server-side grid-enabled algorithms
        currently are running on a single front-end server not meant for
        heavy computational use.  That server is not configured for computing on large
        datasets or for long-running jobs.
