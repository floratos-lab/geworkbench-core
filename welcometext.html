  <strong> Java Memory:</strong> geWorkbench running in 64-bit Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) will now default to requesting up to 2 GB of memory for Java.  For use on 64-bit versions of Windows and on Mac OSX, we now include additional command files to start geWorkbench with a Java memory limit of 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 GB.  Requesting larger amounts of memory may be needed when you are analysing very large datasets.  These command files are located in the geWorkbench installation directory and have the form, e.g. for requesting Java memory of 4 GB, of "<strong>launch_geworkbench_winpc_4G.bat</strong>" for Windows and "<strong>launch_geworkbench_macosx_4G.command</strong>" for Mac OSX.  You can make short-cuts from these files and copy them to a convenient location such as your desktop.  Double-clicking on the original file or its short-cut will start geWorkbench with the requested maximum Java memory limit (See special note for MacOSX below).  You should make sure your computer has sufficient physical RAM memory, e.g. on a machine with 8 GB of physical memory you might limit your request to 4 GB of memory for Java.<br>
  <br><strong>IMPORTANT note for MacOSX (Gatekeeper function, MacOSX 10.7.3 and higher):</strong>
		   The first time you attempt to start geWorkbench from one of
           the command or alias files, right-click on the
           file and select "Open".  You will be prompted as to whether you want to
           open this file from an unidentified developer; answer yes.  After this
           first time, on subsequent invocations you can start geWorkbench
           just by double-clicking on the alias or command file.
