  <h3>CEL file viewer</h3> 
  

The Affymetrix CEL file contains a single intensity value calculated for each probe on the chip. It is derived from the raw image (.dat) file. Individual Affymetrix CEL files can be read into geWorkbench. They are displayed in the CEL file viewer. This can be used to check for obvious problems such as fingerprints or uneven drying which could affect data quality. Note that is file is not an exact image of the chip, but a reconstructed image at the probe level. The CEL file viewer component is simply a viewer, it does not permit any operations on the image.
