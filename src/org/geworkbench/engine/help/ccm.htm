<a name="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>geWorkbench  supports the dynamic loading and
unloading of individual components for analysis and visualization. The
Component Configuartion Manager (CCM) lists each available component,
provides descriptive and license information, and controls loading and
unloading. The ability to customize the loaded components may be useful
to those who intend only to use particular types of analysis. It may in
some cases also increase the responsiveness of the application, as
potentially fewer viewers may need to respond to particular data events
(new data set, marker set activation etc.).
</p><p><br>As shipped, the CCM may appear as in the figure below, with
only basic components configured. Individual components can be added by
clicking on their check boxes.

</p><p><br>
</p><p>As each component is added, additional components may also be
required, e.g. adding an analysis may require a particular viewer.
These dependencies are all handled in the CCM. An example is shown in
the following figure, where adding the ARACNe component also requires
adding the Cytoscape component.

</p><p><br>If a component requires agreeing to a license, the license
will also be displayed at this time, with the option to accept or
reject it.

<a name="Individual_controls"></a><h2>Individual controls</h2>
<ul><li> <b>Display</b>&nbsp;: All, Only Loaded, Only Unloaded - selects which components to display.
</li><li> <b>Show by type</b>: All, Parsers, Analysis plugins, Visualizers - filters displayed components by their category of action.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Name</b>: Component name
</li><li> <b>Version</b>: Component version
</li><li> <b>Author</b>: Component author or source of primary calculation code.
</li><li> <b>Author URL</b>: some components have a URL to the author's website configured.
</li><li> <b>Tool URL</b>: some components have a URL to their own website configured.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>View license</b> - If a license is required for a
component, it can be displayed by highlighting the component in the
list and pressing this button.
</li><li> <b>View documentation</b> - Provided for displaying extra documentation about the component if available.
</li><li> <b>View external site</b> - same as the Tool URL link.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Apply</b> - if any changes have been made to the
check-boxes indicating which components are to be loaded, pushing
"Apply" causes the changes to actually be be made. </li><li> <b>Reset</b> - If changes have been made but "Apply" has not been pushed, set all checkboxes  back to their previous state.
</li><li> <b>Close</b> - Close the CCM window.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>On/Off</b> - checking/unchecking this box will
select/deselect all optional components. As implemented, it will
require responding to all dependency messages, so its use is not
recommended at this time.
</li></ul>
