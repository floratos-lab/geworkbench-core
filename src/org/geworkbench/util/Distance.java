 * (e.g., the vectors could be genes or microarrays.)
 * The distance could be Euclidean, Pearson, or Spearman. <emph>If one vector is longer
 * than the other, we compute upto the shorter one and the rest values of the longer
 * one are ignored. If a value is not a number, we silently skip the value.</emph> </p>
