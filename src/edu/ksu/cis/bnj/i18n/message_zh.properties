// Roby Joehanes' note: Chinese characters are inputted using unicode only. There are no other ways
// To know what unicode it is, visit:
// http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U4E00.pdf

// To display Chinese font on BNJ correctly under non-Chinese Windows, change all fonts
// (menu, title, etc) under Windows' Display properties, on Appearance tab, click button "Advance"
// All fonts must be changed to "Arial Unicode MS"

// TODO: This is a copy of Japanese properties. Fix later.
